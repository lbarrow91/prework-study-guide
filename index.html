          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

          <li>The element that holds all the other elements is known as the parent element - such as the BODY element</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but is less flexible because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet can be applyed to a whole parent element such as 'Head' - the rules only apply to that page and a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>We use a 'link' element to link the external CCS style sheet within the HTML</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element - it is not visable on the page</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element inside the border</li>
          <li>For the selector, a special wild card symbol, or *, applies the rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>We add the link to the external CSS style sheet to the 'head'section of the HTML code. The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource and the 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL)</li>
          <li>The full stop preceding the class designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values</li>
          <li>JavaScript link is placed at the bottom of the HTML code as the browser reads code in the order it appears in the file</li>
          <li>If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends</li>
          <li>Number and Boolean (True/False) variables don't need quote marks</li>
          <li>You can add comments by enclosing them in /* or // - the browser ignores them</li>
          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts</li>
          <li>'if' statements allows us to interrupt control flow</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>In JavaScript the first item in any array has an index of 0</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task and only executes when called by name</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
