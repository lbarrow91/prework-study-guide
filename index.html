        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visable content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what apppears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the other elements is known as the parent element - such as the BODY element</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but is less flexible because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet can be applyed to a whole parent element such as 'Head' - the rules only apply to that page and a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>We use a 'link' element to link the external CCS style sheet within the HTML</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element - it is not visable on the page</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element inside the border</li>
          <li>For the selector, a special wild card symbol, or *, applies the rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>We add the link to the external CSS style sheet to the 'head'section of the HTML code. The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource and the 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL)</li>
          <li>The full stop preceding the class designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
